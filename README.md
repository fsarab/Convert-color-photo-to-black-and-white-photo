# Convert-color-photo-to-black-and-white-photo
There are many ways to convert a color image to a black and white
image.A grayscale image is an image in which a single pixel represents
the amount of light or only contains light intensity information.
It is in RGB images there are three color channels (red, green and blue)
so three dimensions, while grayscale images are unidimensional.
We use Python programming language in this project, we will also take
help from PIL (pillow), Matplotlib and mathematical formulas
